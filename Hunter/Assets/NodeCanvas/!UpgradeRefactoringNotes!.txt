Here is a good way you can refactor your custom Tasks created prior of version 2 and to version 2:

1. Open up your favorite IDE.

2. Fix Namespaces:

Do an Edit -> "Replace In Files" and replace:
"using NodeCanvas.Variables;" to
"using NodeCanvas.Framework; using ParadoxNotion.Design;"

3. Replace BBVariables:

Do an Edit -> "Replace In Files" and replace:
"BBGameObject"	to	"BBParameter<GameObject>"
"BBFloat"		to	"BBParameter<float>"
"BBString"		to	"BBParameter<string>"
"BBVector"		to	"BBParameter<Vector3>"
and so on...
